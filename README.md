# HabitLock AI 🧠🔓
**The Friction-Based Gatekeeper for High-Performers.**

HabitLock AI is not a simple app blocker. It is a cognitive intervention tool designed to help users reclaim their focus by turning "Doomscrolling" into "Earned Access."

## 🚀 The Product Vision
Instead of hard-blocking distracting apps (WhatsApp, Instagram, LinkedIn), HabitLock AI introduces **Intentional Friction**. To access these apps, you must first "pay" with progress on your habits.

### Key Features (The "PM Roadmap")
1.  **The Nudge Overlay:** When a distracting app is opened, a full-screen "Gatekeeper" appears.
2.  **Proof-of-Work (AI Verification):** - **Reading:** Take a photo of a book page; AI confirms the content and asks a summary question.
    - **Fitness:** AI verifies gym/workout context via camera.
3.  **Earned Access:** Habit completion earns "Focus Credits" (e.g., 10 pages read = 15 mins of social media).
4.  **The "Choice" Exit:** Users can bypass the block, but only after typing a manual confirmation of their choice to lose focus.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Framework:** Flutter (Cross-platform iOS/Android)
- **AI Engine:** Google Gemini API (Vision-to-Text & Summarization)
- **Backend:** Firebase (No-cost tier for user credits & habit tracking)
- **System Logic:** Accessibility Services (Android) & Screen Time API (iOS)
